# Dino Game

Welcome to the Dino Game repository! This project is inspired by the classic Chrome dinosaur game and aims to provide a fun and interactive gaming experience.

## Overview

The Dino Game is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a dinosaur character and tries to avoid obstacles by jumping over them. The game progressively increases in speed, providing a challenging experience for players of all skill levels.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls: The game can be played using just one key (usually the spacebar) for jumping, making it easy for players to pick up and enjoy.
- Endless gameplay: The game features an endless level design, where the player's objective is to survive for as long as possible by avoiding obstacles.
- Increasing difficulty: As the game progresses, the speed of the dinosaur and the frequency of obstacles increase, providing an ever-growing challenge for the player.
- Score tracking: Players can track their score, which increases as they successfully navigate past obstacles. They can compete with themselves or others to achieve the highest score.
